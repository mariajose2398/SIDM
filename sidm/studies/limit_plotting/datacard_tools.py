"""Signal-region yields -> Combine counting datacards for the SIDM ABCD analysis.

The merged ``.coffea`` outputs store one ``Hist`` per observable with axes
``(channel, <observable>, abcd_region)``.  ``abcd_region`` is an ``IntCategory``
with ``0 = A``, the signal region of the ABCD plane, so the SR count for a
sample is simply that histogram summed over the observable axis at
``abcd_region == 0`` for the SR channel.

Two details matter for getting the count right:

* The histograms are already scaled to ``lumi * xs`` by
  ``sidm_processor.postprocess``, so the sums are yields, not raw entries.
  Signal has no entry in ``configs/cross_sections.yaml``, so
  ``utilities.get_xs`` falls back to 1 fb -- signal yields (and therefore the
  Combine signal strength ``r``) are relative to a 1 fb reference cross section.
* The observable axis is ``Regular`` and does overflow (a few percent for the
  pt axes), so sums must use ``flow=True``.  With flow included the SR sum
  reproduces the final row of the corresponding cutflow exactly.

The ``Weight`` storage carries the sum of squared weights, so each yield comes
with its MC statistical uncertainty, which is what the per-process MC
statistical nuisance in the datacards is built from.

    a log-normal built from the same relative error, and ``None`` writes no MC
